# Implicit Intents Reciever
## It's a very simple app that receives an implicit Intent to open the URI for a web page. When activated by an implicit Intent, that app displays the requested URI as a string in a TextView. The receiver app has a very restrictive Intent filter that matches only exact URI protocol (http) and host (developer.android.com). Any other URI opens in the default web browser.

**The Implicit Intents Receiver app launches and the message shows the URI from the Implicit Intents app.**
